# 🌌 Beyond Sunlight: Thalasson – An Aquatic Chemosynthetic World

**NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024**  
Category: *Beyond Sunlight: An Aquatic Chemosynthetic World*

---

## 🌊 Overview

Thalasson is a fictional ocean world designed to explore the possibility of life without sunlight — powered entirely by **chemosynthesis**. This Python project generates a 3D model of Thalasson's ocean floor, featuring **hydrothermal vents**, **volcanic terrain**, and **chemical plumes** where life could thrive.

> On Earth, ecosystems depend heavily on sunlight. But what if life could evolve in total darkness, powered by chemical energy?  
> This project visualizes such a possibility through data-driven terrain simulation and creative astrobiology.
